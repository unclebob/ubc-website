:description "
A classic book on Object Oriented Design, written by one of the founding masters of the
technique.  This is the book that defines the Open-Closed principle, and so much more.
There is a lot of gold in this book.  Anyone who aspires to be a master of Object Oriented
software design would benefit from a careful read.

Meyer is the author of the _Eiffel_ language, in which the code examples are all written.
Eiffel is a beautiful language; which introduced the discipline of _Design By Contract_ to the
industry.  Sadly the language has passed into obscurity.  The discipline, however, remains;
and is one that any software craftsman should know.

The second edition, written a decade later, is much larger.  I find the size intimidating so
I prefer the first edition.  But that's just me.
