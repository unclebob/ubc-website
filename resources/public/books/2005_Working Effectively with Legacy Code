:description "This is the only book I know of that addresses this topic; and Michael Feathers
handles it masterfully.  But, be warned, the book does not provide you with a magic wand.
Don't come here looking for a quick fix.

However the book is jammed with lots of useful and relevant techniques for getting your arms
around a large and unruly code base.

Perhaps the greatest insight in the book is the definition of legacy code.
