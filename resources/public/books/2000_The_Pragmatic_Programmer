Ward Cunningham gave me a copy of this book and recommended that I read it.  What a wonderful experience.
Andy and Dave have packed this tome full of good, rock, solid advice about how to be a good programmer.
This advice is personal, as opposed to technical.  It's about how to behave, and about the mindset of
a professional, rather than about coding tips and techniques.  As such, the advice it timeless and highly valuable.
