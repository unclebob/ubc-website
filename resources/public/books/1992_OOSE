I remember being at a conference in Europe when this book was released.  We had all
been eagerly waiting for it to arrive.  We lined up at the publisher's booth and bought our
copies.

This is the book that introduced _Use Cases_ to the industry.  But more than that, this was
the book that first showed us the linkage between Use Cases, Object Oriented Design, and
Architecture.

The concepts in this book are timeless; and every aspiring software architect should be
familiar with them.
