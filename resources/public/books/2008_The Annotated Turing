:description "Have you read Alan Turing's 1936 paper:
_On Computable Numbers, With An Applications to the Entscheidungsproblem_?  If not, and even
if you have, you _must_ read this book.

You may remember the author from the many volumes he wrote in the 90s and 2000s extolling the
virtues of Microsoft Windows.  But nevermind that.  _This_ book is his _Magnum Opus_ and it is,
frankly, _outstanding_.

In the pages of this book you will find the entirety of Alan Turing's ground-breaking paper.  However, Petzold
surrounds each paragraph of that paper with a depth of history, commentary, and explanation that
exposes both Turing's brilliance, and Petzold's diligence.

If it seems like I'm gushing, I am.  I've read this book through twice, and I'll likely read
it through again.  It is an utter joy.  It is also invaluable as a means to understand
our fascinating profession of computer programming.
