When my son was 11, he was on a hockey team.  As all hockey parents know, your player will be
on the ice for 5 minutes and then cooling down for 10.  When my son was on the ice I was
cheering for him.  When he was off the ice I was cheering for what I was reading in this book.

_Refactoring_ is the first book I ever read that presented code as something _malleable_.
Other books presented code in final form, but this book showed how you could take poorly
written code and transform it, step by step, into much better code with a much better design.

The book begins as an extremely effective tutorial, and then transitions into an encyclopedia
of code smells and refactorings.  It is utterly brilliant.

Martin has written a second edition for those who'd rather read javascript than java.
Either way, the book is a must read.
