:description "Only Kent Beck could write a book like this.  His style is uniquely brilliant, and the content
is well worth the read.

_Tidy First?_ describes:
 * When to tidy messy code before changing what it computes..
 * How to tidy messy code safely and efficiently.
 * How to stop tidying messy code.
 * Why tyding works.

The message is simple:  _Keep things clean_.  Don't add new code to messy code.  Clean up the mess first.
The author investigates this idea from three different viewpoints.  First he offers a set of code _tidyings_,
then considers the management implications, and finally the overall theory.

The book is concise, conversational, and deeply insightful."
