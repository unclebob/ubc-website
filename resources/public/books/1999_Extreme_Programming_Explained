The first edition is better than the second, in my opinion.

This is the book in which Kent Beck introduced Extreme Programming (XP) to the industry.  It is
simple, direct, and unambiguous.  The writing style is friendly and approachable.  It is a joy
to read.

This is also the book that kicked the _Agile_ movement into high-gear and eventually enabled
those of us who favored light-weight software methods to meet in Snowbird to create the
[Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/).

It is hard to imagine, today, how wildly controversial this book was in 1999.  It challenged
so many cherished beliefs and ideologies; and despite a huge backlash, it won the day.

XP remains the most complete and well-defined of all the Agile methods.  You cannot truly
understand Agile without understanding XP.
