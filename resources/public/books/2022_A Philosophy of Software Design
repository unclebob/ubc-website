:description "This is a short book that describes the author's collection of software design principles.

The author worked on a number of software projects, including the Tcl scripting language and the Tk toolkit.
He is currently a professor at Stanford and the book is based on a series of his lectures.

The style is very approachable, and his arguments are well-reasoned and persuasive.  I especially liked his
his notion that modules should have narrow interfaces and deep implementations.  There are many good insights
in this book, and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in software design.

The author has some complaints about _Clean Code_ that he and I have been debating.  He likes his functions
to be bigger than I do; and he wants to see greater use of comments.  He's also taken
a position against Test Driven Development; but is a strong proponent of unit testing."
