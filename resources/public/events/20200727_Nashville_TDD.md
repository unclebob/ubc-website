###Test Driven Development, 2 days.
**Nashville, TN**<br>
You test first right?  If not, you should.  If you don't know why then Uncle Bob will tell you why and show you how! 
This is a two-day hands-on course in which students learn Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Refactoring. This
course alternates between lecture and exercise so that students can experience, first-hand, the practices and
disciplines of these fundamental topics.
