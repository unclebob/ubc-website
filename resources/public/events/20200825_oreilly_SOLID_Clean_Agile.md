###SOLID: Clean Agile - 3 hours
**O'Reilly Online Learning**
<br>Nearly twenty years after the Agile Manifesto was first presented, 
the legendary Robert C. Martin ("Uncle Bob") reintroduces Agile 
values and principles for a new generation-programmers and 
nonprogrammers alike. Martin, author of Clean Code and other highly 
influential software development guides, was there at Agile's 
founding. Now, in this Clean Agile Live Training, he strips away 
misunderstandings and distractions that over the years have made it 
harder to use Agile than was originally intended.

Martin describes what Agile is in no uncertain terms: a small 
discipline that helps small teams manage small projects . . . with 
huge implications because every big project is comprised of 
many small projects. Drawing on his fifty years' experience with 
projects of every conceivable type, he shows how Agile can help you 
bring true professionalism to software development.
