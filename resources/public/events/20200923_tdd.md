###Test-Driven Development: Mocking & Patterns <br>2 hrs
**ON-Line course**<br>
You test first right? If not, you should. If you don't 
know why then Uncle Bob will tell you why and show you 
how!

This is a two-day hands-on course in which students 
learn Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Refactoring. 
This course alternates between lecture and exercise so 
that students can experience, first-hand, the practices 
and disciplines of these fundamental topics.

This ZOOM presentation
will include 60-90 minutes of lecture and then an 
open Q/A session.
