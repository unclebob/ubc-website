###Component Cohesion Principles, 2 hours.
**ON-Line course**<br>
This two session course describes the principles of mid-level design; 
above the level of classes, but below the level of architecture. 
The primary element of mid-level design is the component. 
We will discuss what components are, what goes into them, 
and how they should relate to each other in a robust design.  

This ZOOM presentation
will include 60-90 minutes of lecture and then an open Q/A session.
