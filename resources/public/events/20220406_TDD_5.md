###Test Driven Development - Online - 2 hrs
***Week 5:  The Big Picture***

You test first right? If not, you should. 
If you don't know why then Uncle Bob will tell you why and
show you how!

In this 5 week hands-on course students learn Test-Driven Development 
(TDD) and Refactoring. This course alternates between lecture and 
exercise so that students can experience, first-hand, 
the practices and disciplines of these fundamental topics.

This ZOOM presentation
will include 60-90 minutes of lecture and then an 
open Q/A session.
