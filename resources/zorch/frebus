#Long Wave Ultra Violet Light is cool, isn't it?
##Especially when it is produced by a little LED that emits light
##with a wavelength of 395nm (nanometer, billionth of a meter).<br>
##I think so.

Do you know what LED stands for?  It stands for "Light Emitting Diode".<br>
Do you know what a Diode is?  It's a little silicon device that allows electrons to flow in one direction<br>
but not in the other.  And when those electrons flow in the right direction, they fall down an energy gradient; and in the<br>
process they give off light.  Cool right?
Actually, yes, they are quite cool.  They barely give off any heat.<br>

Anyway, I need you to find another cool LED light.<br>

Let's see, It's around here somewhere.  Um.
